Financial Analysis ● Income to the Project: Provide assumptions and projected income streams relevant to the project. ● Quantifiable Output of the Project: List measurable outputs (e.g., infrastructure developed, services provided, beneficiaries trained, etc.). ● Profit and Loss Account and Cash Flow Statement: Provide a summary of projected profits, losses, and cash flows. ● Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR): Calculate NPV and BCR based on assumed discount rates and benefits. ● Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR): Estimate IFRR based on projected financial returns. ● Unit Cost Analysis: Break down the cost per unit of output (e.g., cost per beneficiary, cost per facility, etc.). ● Break Even Point (BEP): Calculate the time required for the project to break even. ● Payback Period: Estimate the time required to recover the initial investment. ● Return on Equity (ROE): Calculate ROE based on equity investment assumptions. 2. Economic Analysis ● Taxes & Duties: Provide a breakdown of taxes and duties included in the capital and operating costs. ● Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR): Calculate NPV and BCR from an economic perspective. ● Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR): Estimate IERR based on economic benefits. ● Employment Analysis: Direct Employment Generation: Estimate the number of jobs created directly by the project. ● Indirect Employment Generation: Estimate the number of jobs created indirectly (e.g., through supply chains). 3. Social Benefits Social Indicators: List social benefits (e.g., improved education, healthcare, skill development, community uplift) with measurable indicators. 4. Environmental Impact Assessment ● Positive Environmental Impacts: Describe any positive environmental effects (e.g., renewable energy use, reduced carbon footprint, improved waste management). ● Negative Environmental Impacts: Identify potential negative impacts (e.g., land use changes, waste generation, resource depletion) and mitigation measures. 5. Sensitivity Analysis Impact of Delays: Analyze the impact of potential delays on project cost and viability.
